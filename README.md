# Project Report: Stock Price Prediction System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The financial market's volatility and complexity make accurate stock price prediction a crucial task. This project aims to develop a robust stock price prediction system integrated with a user-friendly website, providing users with timely insights for informed investment decisions.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for stock price prediction.
- Integrate the model with a website to enable user interaction.
- Implement a notification system to deliver predictions via SMS and email.

## 2. Literature Review

In this section, we review existing literature on stock price prediction, discussing various models and techniques. Noteworthy approaches include the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and ensemble methods like Random Forests. Technologies commonly employed in financial data analysis include Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection
Data is collected from financial databases, including historical stock prices, trading volumes, economic indicators, and news sentiment analysis. Python libraries such as pandas and yfinance are used for data retrieval.

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and creating relevant derived features. Tools like pandas and scikit-learn are utilized for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.

### 3.3 Machine Learning Models
LSTM and GRU neural networks are selected for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in time series data. Python, TensorFlow, and Keras are used for model development and training.

### 3.4 Integration with Website
The website is developed using the Django web framework (Python) for its simplicity and versatility. User profiles are managed through Django's built-in authentication system, providing a secure and seamless experience.

### 3.5 Notification System
The Twilio API is integrated for SMS notifications, while SMTP email services handle email notifications. Twilio's Python library simplifies SMS integration, and Django's email module streamlines email notifications.

## 4. Implementation

The project is implemented using Python 3.x. Key libraries include pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Django, Twilio, and SMTP for email services. The website is styled using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Code snippets and scripts are available in the GitHub repository.

## 5. Results

Results showcase the accuracy of the machine learning models in predicting stock prices. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used for evaluation. Examples of successful predictions are illustrated to demonstrate the practical application of the system.

## 6. Discussion

Challenges faced during the project include obtaining reliable financial data, optimizing model performance, and ensuring real-time prediction updates. Limitations include the inherent unpredictability of financial markets. Future improvements may involve incorporating alternative data sources, refining feature engineering, and exploring advanced neural network architectures.

## 7. Conclusion

The project successfully achieves its objectives by providing a comprehensive stock price prediction system. The integrated website ensures user-friendly interaction, and the notification system enhances user engagement. The machine learning models exhibit promising accuracy, contributing valuable insights for investors.

## 8. Future Work

Potential enhancements include real-time updates, sentiment analysis from social media, and expanding the range of supported financial instruments. Collaboration with financial experts for further model validation and the integration of more advanced machine learning techniques are avenues for future exploration.
